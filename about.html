  <p>Hello there! I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at Censius Inc.</p>
  <p>My typical day at work involves:
    <br>‚ú¶ Research, prototyping and discussions on product features
    <br>‚ú¶ Product roadmap documentation
    <br>‚ú¶ Review media content and resources 
    <br>‚ú¶ Pre-sales pitches
  </p>

  <p>I will be defending my Ph.D. thesis soon ü§ûüèº. 
    <br>Specialising in data privacy, my Ph.D. work dabbled with differential privacy and synthetic data.</p>

  <p class="mb-5">I'm a mediocre runner who's a mom to two rescued dogs and one non-rescued human.</p>
