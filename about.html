  <p>Hello there! I am currently working as a Senior Data Scientist at Censius Inc.</p>
  <p>My typical day at work involves: <br>
  &bull; Research, prototyping and discussions on product features <br>
  &bull; Product roadmap documentation <br>
  &bull; Review media content and resources <br>
  &bull; Pre sales pitches <br>

  <p>I will be defending my Ph.D. thesis soon. Specialising in data privacy, my Ph.D. work dabbled with differential privacy and synthetic data.</p>

  <p class="mb-5">I'm a mediocre runner who's a mom to two rescued dogs and one non-rescued human.</p>
